[{"Section_title":"Visiting Our Church","Content":"It does make a difference what you believe. This is the theme of Hartwell Baptist Church.  What you believe about something defines your actions and reactions to the events of life. What you believe about certain foods determines what you eat.  What you believe about politics determines who you vote for or against.  But, what you believe about the Bible casts a light about every area of life.\n\n\nAt Hartwell Baptist Church we preach and teach not just about the Bible but we teach and preach the truth directly from the Bible.  We believe that Bible truth is the guiding light we need in our lives."},{"Section_title":"Our Services","Content":"You are always welcome to join us for any one of our services.
