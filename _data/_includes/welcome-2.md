
## What To Expect

I would like to take a minute to welcome you to our church and to explain just what you can expect should you choose to visit our congregation.  This information is being given in order of experience and not in order of importance.

**First, you would find a welcoming and loving family of Christ.**  We strive to exemplify the command to become a unified body serving Christ.  As such, we welcome visitors and strive to be a source of encouragement and support for all those we come in contact with.

**Second, you would find others within your stage of life.** Though we are not a large church, our church is blessed to have a wide range of believers from all age groups and from all walks of life.  We have Sunday school classes for every age group from nursery to adults.  There is also a Junior Church program for children between the ages of 4-7, which is run during the morning sermon.

**Third, you would notice that our church is blended in its dress styles.**  On any Sunday one would see dresses, suits, and jeans.

**Fourth, you can expect our music to be a blend of tradition hymns with some choruses and praise music.** The Scriptures command us to sing unto the Lord with psalms (Scripture put to music), hymns (doctrine put to music), and spiritual songs (songs of praise and encouragement).  As such we strive to incorporate each of these into our music while keeping the glory and emphasis on Christ.

**Finally, you can expect the Word of God to be the emphasis of each service and ministry of this church.**  Whether it is Sunday School, the morning or evening service, Bible study, or Youth Group the Word of God is our priority.  The average morning service begins at 11:00 and ends around 12:15, of that time the majority is the preaching and teaching of the Word.  No church can long be used by God if it abandons the teaching of His Word.  The Word is taught in a very engaging and captivating way, with an emphasis on both instruction and application.

 I hope that these little bits of information were helpful in preparing you for what you can expect at CBC.  We hope to see you soon, and if you have any questions please call us at 814-756-5287.  God Bless.
